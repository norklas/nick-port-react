## SPA React Portfolio

## Description

A single page application portfolio where a user can navigate to different sections of my page via navigation bar. I've accomplished this by using useState() and conditionally rendering the page with if statements. The useState contains both currentPage and setCurrentPage. For example, if currentPage === "About", then we would return the About component. By default, the useState is set to About.

## Installation

No installation required since we've deployed a live link, which can be viewed here, https://norklas.github.io/nick-port-react/

However, if you'd like to clone the repo, simply type ``npm i`` after cloning to install the dependencies, then type ``npm start`` to run and view the site.

## Usage

The website is fairly basic, the icons at located in the footer will take you to my LinkedIn, Github, my email, or download my resume. Each card under the portfolio page will have buttons to take you to the deployed site or the GitHub repository. The contact form has fields that will be required for submission.
